# MCAD grainbelt
Grainbelt case study for MCAD final project

## About
This is my final project for the Web Development course at Minneapolis College of Art and DEsign. In this project I dissected the work of Schell's brewing's [Grainbelt's homepage](https://www.grainbelt.com/) along with one of their beers [Nordeast](https://www.grainbelt.com/beers/nordeast/), and then developed a component library from my study.
